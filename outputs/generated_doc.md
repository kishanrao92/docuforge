1. /Users/kishan/Projects/docuforge/test-configs/deployment.yml (yml): This is a Kubernetes Deployment configuration file. The key setting is that it deploys an application called "siddhi" with 2 replicas, using the image `siddhi:0.1`. The deployed containers will be accessible on port 8080.

  2. /Users/kishan/Projects/docuforge/test-configs/main.tf (tf): This is a Terraform file that sets up an AWS resource, specifically an EC2 instance in the 'us-east-1' region. The instance will use the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) `ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0` and the instance type 't2.micro'. It will also be tagged with 'Name = "ExampleInstance"'.

  3. /Users/kishan/Projects/docuforge/test-configs/service.yaml (yaml): This is a Kubernetes Service configuration file. The service is called "my-app-service" and has a ClusterIP type. It selects pods with the label 'app: my-app' and exposes port 80 on the service, which will target port 8080 on the connected containers.

  4. /Users/kishan/Projects/docuforge/test-configs/test.hcl (hcl) and /Users/kishan/Projects/docuforge/test-configs/test.tf: These files seem to be empty or not properly formatted, so there are no resources or settings to summarize from them.

  5. /Users/kishan/Projects/docuforge/test-configs/vpc.tf (tf): This is a Terraform file that sets up an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the CIDR block "10.0.0.0/16". The VPC will also be tagged with 'Name = "MainVPC"'.
